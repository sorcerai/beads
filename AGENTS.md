# Agent Instructions

<!-- bd-doctor-divergence: ok -->

See [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for full instructions.

This file exists for compatibility with tools that look for AGENTS.md.

The marker above tells `bd doctor` that the intentional divergence between
this file and `CLAUDE.md` (different audiences, different reading orders) is
expected and should not be flagged.

## Key Sections

- **Issue Tracking** - How to use bd for work management
- **Development Guidelines** - Code standards and testing
- **Project Scope** - Read [docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md](docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md) before adding new feature surface area
- **Visual Design System** - Status icons, colors, and semantic styling for CLI output
- **Contributor Protection** - Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before handling external PRs
- **Maintainer PR Guidelines** - Read [PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md](PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md) before triaging, landing, or closing PRs

## Project Scope

Before adding new feature surface area, read
[docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md](docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md). Beads owns issue tracking
primitives and should not encode orchestration-layer policy, become a storage
engine, or casually expand the database schema when metadata would work.

## PR Safety for Agents

Before triaging, reviewing, landing, closing, or otherwise maintaining PRs, read
[PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md](PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md). The maintainer
policy is to maximize community throughput: find useful contributor value,
absorb or transform it locally when practical, preserve attribution, and use
request-changes only as a last resort.

Before implementing work, opening a PR, or merging/closing a PR, run the PR
preflight:
```bash
scripts/pr-preflight.sh --search "<topic keywords>" --repo gastownhall/beads
scripts/pr-preflight.sh <pr-number> --repo gastownhall/beads
```

External contributor PRs have priority. Review and build on their branch when
possible, preserve their tests and attribution, and never close or supersede
their PR silently. If a rewrite is unavoidable, explain why on the original PR
and credit their design/tests.

## Visual Design Anti-Patterns

**NEVER use emoji-style icons** (🔴🟠🟡🔵⚪) in CLI output. They cause cognitive overload.

**ALWAYS use small Unicode symbols** with semantic colors:
- Status: `○ ◐ ● ✓ ❄`
- Priority: `● P0` (filled circle with color)

See [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for full development guidelines.

## Storage Boundary

The canonical storage boundary is in
[docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md](docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md#storage-boundary). In short:
Beads talks to storage through a driver interface (`dolthub/driver` for Dolt).
Do not add beads-side flocks, engine introspection, storage-specific retry or
crash-recovery logic, or public SDK return types that leak driver internals.
If the boundary is too narrow, widen the interface or route the issue to the
driver instead of patching around it in beads.

## Agent Warning: Interactive Commands

**DO NOT use `bd edit`** - it opens an interactive editor ($EDITOR) which AI agents cannot use.

Use `bd update` with flags instead:
```bash
bd update <id> --description "new description"
bd update <id> --title "new title"
bd update <id> --design "design notes"
bd update <id> --notes "additional notes"
bd update <id> --acceptance "acceptance criteria"

# Use stdin for descriptions with special characters (backticks, !, nested quotes)
echo 'Description with `backticks` and "quotes"' | bd create "Title" --description=-
echo 'Updated text' | bd update <id> --description=-
```

## Testing Commands (No Ambiguity)

- Default local test command: `make test` (or `./scripts/test.sh`).
- Opt-in ICU regex path: `make test-icu-path` (or `./scripts/test-icu-path.sh ./...`).
- This ICU path is maintainer-only and not part of normal validation; `make test-full-cgo` and `./scripts/test-cgo.sh` are deprecated aliases.
- For package- or test-scoped shipped-config CGO runs, prefer:
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags gms_pure_go ./cmd/bd/...
CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags gms_pure_go -run '^TestName$' ./cmd/bd/...
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
